# Chromedash

Do you happen to use the popular documentation browser [Dash](https://kapeli.com/dash)? Do you also dislike setting a global hotkey for launching Dash with your query; instead preferring to set your hotkey within the current application you are using? Do you also use Chrome? 

This may be the extension for you.  

## Getting Started

Because this extension is not yet available via the Chrome Web Store, you must launch it as an unpacked extension.

### Installing
